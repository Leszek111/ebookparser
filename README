eBook parser library - a Java library designed to handle the e-book formats: epub and fb2.

The main advantage of this program is the instantaneous (i would even say 
like greased lightning, compared to other programs) information processing.

Library to retrieve the file e-book information such as title, author, 
genre, series title, etc. This library can be used to organize databases of 
e-books, also can be used in programs of processing a large number 
of e-books, where speed is essential. At the same time, the program does not 
extract all content from e-book, does not check e-book structure for errors
etc. It only reads from it a small amount of information, sufficient for 
most applications. In this way we obtain the instantaneous speed of 
information processing.

Use of the library is very simple, just add the following lines in the your code

	import ebook.*;
	import ebook.parser.*;

	Parser parser = new InstantParser();
	EBook ebook = parser.parse(filename);
	if (ebook.isOk) {
		// do anything with ebook
	} 

To date, the program supports the formats .fb2 and .epub. In further 
assumed processing other formats.
